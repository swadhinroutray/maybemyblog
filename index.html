<p class="lead">
  I'm Swadhin, currently a grad student at Carnegie Mellon University.
</p>

In my <b><i>mid-length</i></b> academic life, I have devoted my time to
understanding computers and their effect on humans.<br />
<br />
<i>
  What they are, and why do I feel the need to protect people from people(and
  now even AI) who manipulate them to do bad things?<br />
</i>
<br />
My passion for protecting people, got me looking for ways to protect user data
at the ground level. I found the perfect fit for my vision, in the form of
<a href="https://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/">Privacy Engineering</a> at CMU, where I've
spent my time understanding privacy, its nuances in different domains, and how
technology can be leveraged to protect <i>humans</i> truly. <br />
<br />

My interests lie in the areas of Privacy Enhancing Technologies(PETs), with
experience in working with Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption and
Private Set Intersection. I'm a computer scientist by training (internships
during my undergrad) and education (bachelor's in computers and communications)
and have experience in SWE and DevOps roles.<br />
<br />

Always motivated to learn something new and collaborate in a variety of domains.

title: About Me

<p class="lead">I'm Swadhin, currently a grad student at Carnegie Mellon University. </p>

In my <i><b>mid-length</b></i> academic life, I have devoted my time to understanding computers, and the effect they have on humans.<br>

<i>What they are, and why I feel the need to protect people from prople who manipulate them to do bad things? <br>

My passion for protecting people, got me looking for ways to protect user data at the ground level. I found the perfect fit for my vision, in the form of the [Privacy Engineering](https://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/) grad degree at CMU, where I've spent my time understanding privacy, it's nuances in different domains, and how technology can be leveraged to truly protect <i>humans</i>. <br>

I'm a computer science engineer by training and education, and have experience in SWE and DevOps roles.

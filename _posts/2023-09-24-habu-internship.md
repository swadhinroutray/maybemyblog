summary: A brief summary of my summer internship experience at Habu Inc
---

I am a computer science grad with a specialization in privacy. I am passionate about all things software engineering and its intersection with responsible, anonymous and private technology. I do not have an inclination towards ML. So the next logical step was to focus on data-intensive areas which involve humans. In comes AdTech, MarTech and FinTech.
My keen interest in working on data-intensive application lead me the incredible, hot and upcoming privacy-oriented industry of clean-rooms. To put in simple words:

<i> "You got data? I got data. I don't trust you, and you don't trust me. So let's do one thing, let's bring our data into an <b>isolated environment</b> where neither of us have access to each other's data. And most importantly, let's draw insights from a combination of this data."</i>

This isolated data collaboration environment is called a <b> Clean Room</b>.

To give you a brief idea about what it means technologically, [Habu](https://habu.com/data-clean-room-software/), an industry leader in the data collaboration domain, explains their architecture in [Figure 1](#fig1).

<p>Fortunately, even in this dire market, Habu Inc, took a chance on me and brought me in as an intern to help build out a POC for their privacy oriented clean rooms. Over the course of summer'23, I was tasked to research different approaches, come up with a design document for the product and eventually build it out. And honestly, it's the most fun I'd had in a while. Not just because of the work, but more importantly, the people at Habu, who were incredibly encouraging, supportive and amazing.</p>

<p> We built out a Differentially Private clean room framework, which included a budget accounting framework, refresh conditions and support for extensibility. While building this framework for the POC, I gained a ton of experience with microservice architecture, working across different codebases and teams. All in all, an incredible time and experience as an intern.</p>
